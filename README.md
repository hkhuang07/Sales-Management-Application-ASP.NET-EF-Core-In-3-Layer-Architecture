## üèóÔ∏è Technology Stack

The project is built on a modern and robust technology stack, strictly adhering to the 3-Layer Architecture model:

| Layer | Technology | Description |
| :------------------------ | :------------------------------------------- | :-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Presentation (UI)** | `.NET 8 WinForms` | The user interface is built using WinForms, handling user interaction and displaying data from DTOs. |
| **Business Logic (BLL)** | `C# Services`, `AutoMapper`, `DTOs` | Contains the core business logic, data validation, and transformation between Entities and DTOs, interacting with the Repository layer. |
| **Data Access (DAL)** | `Entity Framework Core 8`, `LINQ`, `SQL Server` | Implements the Repository Pattern, using EF Core to manage all database interactions (CRUD, querying), with Code-First and Migrations support. |
| Reporting | `ReportViewerCore.WinForms`, `ClosedXML` | Powerful tools for generating dynamic reports (RDLC) and exporting data to Excel format. |
| Dependency Injection | `Microsoft.Extensions.DependencyInjection` | Helps manage dependencies between layers, increasing modularity and testability. |
| Database | `SQL Server 2022` | Relational database management system used for storing and managing data. |
| ORM | `Entity Framework Core 8` | Modern ORM framework, allowing interaction with the database using C# objects, with strong support for LINQ and features like Async, Caching, Tracking. |

### üí° Design Highlights

* **3-Layer Architecture:** Clear separation of Presentation, Business Logic, and Data Access layers, resulting in clean, maintainable, and scalable code. This is a crucial foundation for future Client-Server deployment.
* **Entity Framework Core (Code-First with Migrations):** Utilizes EF Core 8 with a Code-First approach to define the data model via C# classes and automatically create/update the database schema through Migrations, optimized for .NET 8.
* **AutoMapper:** Helps automate mapping between Entity objects and Data Transfer Objects (DTOs), reducing boilerplate code and improving development efficiency.
* **Dependency Injection (DI):** Integrates .NET's built-in DI, managing object lifetimes and reducing tight coupling between components, supporting Unit Testing.
* **Security:** Passwords are hashed using `BCrypt.Net`, ensuring secure user information.
* **Reporting:** Employs `ReportViewerCore.WinForms` for custom reports and `ClosedXML` for exporting data to Excel.
* **Client-Server Scalability:** The 3-layer architecture combined with ASP.NET (especially EF Core) provides a robust foundation for evolving into a powerful Client-Server application, where the UI could be WinForms or a web/mobile application connecting to backend services via Web API.

## üì• Getting Started

To deploy and run this project on your local machine, please follow these steps:

### 1. Prepare your development environment
* Ensure you have **Visual Studio 2022** (or newer) installed with the **".NET desktop development"** and **"ASP.NET and web development"** workloads.
* Install **SQL Server 2022** (or a compatible version) and **SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS)**.

### 2. Clone Repository
Open Git Bash or Command Prompt and clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone [https://github.com/hkhuang07/Sales-Management-Application-ASP.NET-EF-Core-In-3-Layer-Architecture.git](https://github.com/hkhuang07/Sales-Management-Application-ASP.NET-EF-Core-In-3-Layer-Architecture.git)

```
### 3. Navigate to the project directory
```Bash

cd Sales-Management-Application-ASP.NET-EF-Core-In-3-Layer-Architecture
(Or the path to the project root directory containing the .sln file)
```
### 4. Restore NuGet packages
Open Command Prompt or PowerShell in the root directory of your project (where the .sln file is located) and run the following command to download all necessary dependencies:

```Bash

dotnet restore
# Alternatively, if you are using Visual Studio, you can simply open the .sln file, and VS will automatically restore them.
```
### 5. Configure the Connection String
Open the appsettings.json file (or App.config if it's an older WinForms project) within your ElectronicsStore.Presentation and ElectronicsStore.DataAccess projects (or wherever your DbContext resides) and update the DefaultConnection string to point to your local SQL Server.
Example:

```JSON

"ConnectionStrings": {
  "DefaultConnection": "Server=localhost\\SQLEXPRESS;Database=ElectronicsStoreDb;Trusted_Connection=True;MultipleActiveResultSets=true;TrustServerCertificate=True"
}
```
Replace localhost\\SQLEXPRESS with your SQL Server instance name.

ElectronicsStoreDb is the name of the database that EF Core will create or connect to.

### 6. Initialize and Update the Database with Entity Framework Core Migrations
This project uses the Code-First approach of Entity Framework Core. You need to run Migrations to create or update the database:

Open Package Manager Console in Visual Studio (View > Other Windows > Package Manager Console).

Ensure the Default project is set to your project containing the DbContext (e.g., ElectronicsStore.DataAccess).

Execute the following commands:

```PowerShell

Add-Migration InitialCreate -OutputDir Migrations
Update-Database
```
Add-Migration InitialCreate: This command creates a new Migration named InitialCreate. If you already have Migrations, skip this command or create a new one with an appropriate name if you have structural data changes. -OutputDir Migrations specifies the directory to store the Migration files.

Update-Database: This command applies the created Migrations to your database, creating the database and tables if they don't exist, or updating existing table structures.

### 7. Run the application
Once the database has been initialized, you can run the application from Visual Studio (press F5) or from the Command Line:

```Bash

dotnet run --project ElectronicsStore.Presentation/ElectronicsStore.Presentation.csproj
```
**Important Notes:**
* If you encounter errors during `Update-Database`, please double-check your connection string in `appsettings.json` or `App.config` to ensure it is correct.
* For .NET Core WinForms projects, using a Factory Pattern (e.g., `ElectronicsStoreContextFactory`) is necessary for Entity Framework Core to create `DbContext` at design-time when running Migration commands. Ensure your `ElectronicsStoreContextFactory` is correctly implemented.

## üß† Software Architecture

This project strictly adheres to the **3-Layer Architecture** model, a software design approach that separates application concerns into distinct layers, increasing modularity, maintainability, and scalability.

* **Presentation Layer (UI):**
    * Built using `WinForms`.
    * Responsible for the user interface and direct user interaction.
    * Displays data received from the BLL (via DTOs) and sends user requests to the BLL.
    * Contains no business logic or direct database access.

* **Business Logic Layer (BLL):**
    * Contains `C# Services` and the application's business rules.
    * Uses `AutoMapper` to map between Entity objects (from DAL) and Data Transfer Objects (DTOs) for data transfer between layers.
    * Handles validation logic, calculations, and orchestrates data flow between Presentation and Data Access.
    * Interacts with the DAL through the `Repository Pattern`.

* **Data Access Layer (DAL):**
    * Implements the `Repository Pattern` to provide an abstract interface for data access.
    * Uses `Entity Framework Core` to manage all interactions with the SQL Server database.
    * Contains `DbContext`, `Entities`, and `Migrations`.
    * Contains no business logic or user interface elements.

This 3-layer model is particularly crucial as it lays a solid foundation for future implementation as a Client-Server model. By separating business logic and data access from the user interface, we can easily replace or extend the Presentation layer (e.g., adding an ASP.NET Core WebAPI or Blazor web interface, or a Xamarin/.NET MAUI mobile application) without affecting the underlying layers.
